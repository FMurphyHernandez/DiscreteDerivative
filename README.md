DiscreteDerivative
==================
The idea is to write an article where I present my new idea of a discrete derivative. The new discrete derivative will be defined in the real functions over the integers. For a such function, it is defined the df(x) as the beta in the linear regression of the points (x-1,f(x-1)),(x,f(x)) and (x+1,f(x+1)).
